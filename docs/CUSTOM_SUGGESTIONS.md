## Overview
The `custom_suggestions` tool scans the PR code changes, and automatically generates custom suggestions for improving the PR code.
It shares similarities with the `improve` tool, but with one main difference: the `custom_suggestions` tool will only propose suggestions that follow specific guidelines defined by the prompt in: `pr_custom_suggestions.prompt` configuration.

The tool can be triggered [automatically](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/Usage.md#github-app-automatic-tools) every time a new PR is opened, or can be invoked manually by commenting on a PR.

When commenting, use the following template:

```
/custom_suggestions --pr_custom_suggestions.prompt="The suggestions should focus only on the following:\n-...\n-...\n-..."
```

With a [configuration file](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/Usage.md#working-with-github-app), use the following template:

```
[pr_custom_suggestions]
prompt="""\
The suggestions should focus only on the following:
-...
-...
-...
"""
```
Using a configuration file is recommended, since it allows to use multi-line instructions.

Don't forget - with this tool, you are the prompter. Be specific, clear, and concise in the instructions. Specify relevant aspects that you want the model to focus on. \
You might benefit from several trial-and-error iterations, until you get the correct prompt for your use case.

## Example usage

Here is an example of a possible prompt:
```
[pr_custom_suggestions]
prompt="""\
The suggestions should focus only on the following:
- look for edge cases when implementing a new function
- make sure every variable has a meaningful name
- make sure the code is efficient
"""
```     

The instructions above are just an example. We want to emphasize that the prompt should be specific and clear, and be tailored to the needs of your project.
