For optimal functionality of Qodo Merge, we recommend enabling a wiki for each repository where Qodo Merge is installed. The wiki serves several important purposes:

**Key Wiki Features:**

- Storing a [configuration file](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/usage-guide/configuration_options/#wiki-configuration-file)
- Defining a [`best_practices.md`](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/tools/improve/#best-practices) file
- Track [accepted suggestions](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/tools/improve/#suggestion-tracking)
- Facilitates learning over time by creating an [auto_best_practices.md]() file


**Setup Instructions (GitHub):**

To enable a wiki for your repository:

1. Navigate to your repository's main page on GitHub
2. Select "Settings" from the top navigation bar
3. Locate the "Features" section
4. Enable the "Wikis" option by checking the corresponding box
5. Return to your repository's main page
6. Look for the newly added "Wiki" tab in the top navigation
7. Initialize your wiki by clicking "Create the first page" (this step is important - without creating an initial page, the wiki will not be fully functional)
