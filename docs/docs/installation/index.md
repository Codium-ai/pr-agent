# Installation

## Self-hosted Qodo Merge
If you choose to host your own Qodo Merge, you first need to acquire two tokens:

1. An OpenAI key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), with access to GPT-4 (or a key for other [language models](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/usage-guide/changing_a_model/), if you prefer).
2. A GitHub\GitLab\BitBucket personal access token (classic), with the repo scope. [GitHub from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)]

There are several ways to use self-hosted Qodo Merge:

- [Locally](./locally.md)
- [GitHub](./github.md)
- [GitLab](./gitlab.md)
- [BitBucket](./bitbucket.md)
- [Azure DevOps](./azure.md)

## Qodo Merge Pro 💎
Qodo Merge Pro, an app hosted by CodiumAI for GitHub\GitLab\BitBucket, is also available.

With Qodo Merge Pro, installation is as simple as signing up and adding the Qodo Merge app to your relevant repo.
See [here](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/installation/pr_agent_pro/) for more details.
