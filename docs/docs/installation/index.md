# Installation

## Self-hosted PR-Agent
If you choose to host your own PR-Agent, you first need to acquire two tokens:

1. An OpenAI key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys){:target="_blank"}, with access to GPT-4 (or a key for other [language models](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/usage-guide/changing_a_model/), if you prefer).
2. A GitHub\GitLab\BitBucket personal access token (classic), with the repo scope. [GitHub from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens){:target="_blank"}]

There are several ways to use self-hosted PR-Agent:

- [Locally](./locally.md)
- [GitHub](./github.md)
- [GitLab](./gitlab.md)
- [BitBucket](./bitbucket.md)
- [Azure DevOps](./azure.md)

## Qodo Merge 💎
Qodo Merge, an app hosted by QodoAI for GitHub\GitLab\BitBucket, is also available.

With Qodo Merge, installation is as simple as signing up and adding the Qodo Merge app to your relevant repo.
See [here](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/installation/pr_agent_pro/) for more details.
