## Install Qodo Merge for GitLab (Teams & Enterprise)

Since GitLab platform does not support apps, installing Qodo Merge for GitLab is a bit more involved, and requires the following steps:

#### Step 1

Acquire a personal, project or group level access token. Enable the “api” scope in order to allow Qodo Merge to read pull requests, comment and respond to requests.

</figure>

Store the token in a safe place, you won’t be able to access it again after it was generated.

#### Step 2

Generate a shared secret and link it to the access token. Browse to [https://register.gitlab.pr-agent.codium.ai](https://register.gitlab.pr-agent.codium.ai).
Fill in your generated GitLab token and your company or personal name in the appropriate fields and click "Submit".

You should see "Success!" displayed above the Submit button, and a shared secret will be generated. Store it in a safe place, you won’t be able to access it again after it was generated.

#### Step 3

Install a webhook for your repository or groups, by clicking “webhooks” on the settings menu. Click the “Add new webhook” button.
