## PR-Agent Pro ðŸ’Ž

- When using PR-Agent Pro ðŸ’Ž, hosted by CodiumAI, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, CodiumAI-hosted PR-Agent Pro will use CodiumAIâ€™s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” PR-Agent will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.


## PR-Agent Chrome extension

- The [PR-Agent Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-agent-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Agent tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of PR-Agent.
