## Overview

The `implement` tool converts human code review discussions and feedback into ready-to-commit code changes.
It leverages LLM technology to transform PR comments and review suggestions into concrete implementation code, helping developers quickly turn feedback into working solutions.

## Usage Scenarios


### For Reviewers

Reviewers can request code changes by: <br>
1. Selecting the code block to be modified. <br>
2. Adding a comment with the syntax: 
```
/implement <code-change-description>
```

### For PR Authors

PR authors can implement suggested changes by replying to a review comment using either: <br>
1. Add specific implementation details as described above
```
/implement <code-change-description>
```
2. Use the original review comment as instructions
```
/implement
```

### For Referencing Comments

You can reference and implement changes from any comment by:
```
/implement <link-to-review-comment>
```

Note that the implementation will occur within the review discussion thread.


**Configuration options** <br>
- Use `/implement` to implement code change within and based on the review discussion. <br>
- Use `/implement <code-change-description>` inside a review discussion to implement specific instructions. <br>
- Use `/implement <link-to-review-comment>` to indirectly call the tool from any comment. <br>
