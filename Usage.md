### Introduction

There are 3 basic ways to invoke CodiumAI PR-Agent:
1. Locally running a CLI command
2. Online usage - by [commenting](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/pull/229#issuecomment-1695021901) on a PR
3. Enabling PR-Agent tools to run automatically when a new PR is opened

See the [installation guide](/INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to setup your own PR-Agent.

Specifically, CLI commands can be issued by invoking a pre-built [docker image](/INSTALL.md#running-from-source), or by invoking a [locally cloned repo](INSTALL.md#method-2-run-from-source).

For online usage, you will need to setup either a [GitHub App](INSTALL.md#method-5-run-as-a-github-app), or a [GitHub Action](INSTALL.md#method-3-run-as-a-github-action).
GitHub App and GitHub Action also enable to run PR-Agent specific tool automatically when a new PR is opened.


#### The configuration file
The different tools and sub-tools used by CodiumAI PR-Agent are adjustable via the **[configuration file](pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml)**.
In addition to general configuration options, each tool has its own configurations. For example, the `review` tool will use parameters from the [pr_reviewer](/pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml#L16) section in the configuration file.

**git provider:**
The [git_provider](pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml#L4) field in the configuration file determines the GIT provider that will be used by PR-Agent. Currently, the following providers are supported:
`
"github", "gitlab", "azure", "codecommit", "local"
`

[//]: # (** online usage:**)

[//]: # (Options that are available in the configuration file can be specified at run time when calling actions. Two examples:)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # (- /review --pr_reviewer.extra_instructions="focus on the file: ...")

[//]: # (- /describe --pr_description.add_original_user_description=false -pr_description.extra_instructions="make sure to mention: ...")

[//]: # (```)

### Working from a local repo (CLI)
When running from your local repo (CLI), your local configuration file will be used.

Examples for invoking the different tools via the CLI:

- **Review**:       `python cli.py --pr_url=<pr_url>  review`
- **Describe**:     `python cli.py --pr_url=<pr_url>  describe`
- **Improve**:      `python cli.py --pr_url=<pr_url>  improve`
- **Ask**:          `python cli.py --pr_url=<pr_url>  ask "Write me a poem about this PR"`
- **Reflect**:      `python cli.py --pr_url=<pr_url>  reflect`
- **Update Changelog**:      `python cli.py --pr_url=<pr_url>  update_changelog`

`<pr_url>` is the url of the relevant PR (for example: https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/pull/50).

**Notes:**

(1) in addition to editing your local configuration file, you can also change any configuration value by adding it to the command line:
```
python cli.py --pr_url=<pr_url>  /review --pr_reviewer.extra_instructions="focus on the file: ..."
```

(2) You can print results locally, without publishing them, by setting in `configuration.toml`:
```
[config]
publish_output=true
verbosity_level=2
```
This is useful for debugging or experimenting with the different tools.


### Online usage

Online usage means invoking PR-Agent tools by [comments](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/pull/229#issuecomment-1695021901) on a PR.
Commands for invoking the different tools via comments:

- **Review**:       `/review`
- **Describe**:     `/describe`
- **Improve**:      `/improve`
- **Ask**:          `/ask "..."`
- **Reflect**:      `/reflect`
- **Update Changelog**:      `/update_changelog`


To edit a specific configuration value, just add `--config_path=<value>` to any command.
For example if you want to edit the `review` tool configurations, you can run:
```
/review --pr_reviewer.extra_instructions="..." --pr_reviewer.require_score_review=false
```
Any configuration value in [configuration file](pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml) file can be similarly edited.


### Working with GitHub App
When running PR-Agent from [GitHub App](INSTALL.md#method-5-run-as-a-github-app), the default configurations from a pre-built repo will be initially loaded.

#### GitHub app automatic tools
The [github_app](pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml#L56) section defines GitHub app specific configurations. 
An important parameter is `pr_commands`, which is a list of tools that will be **run automatically when a new PR is opened**:
```
[github_app]
pr_commands = [
    "/describe --pr_description.add_original_user_description=true --pr_description.keep_original_user_title=true",
    "/auto_review",
]
```
This means that when a new PR is opened, PR-Agent will run the `describe` and `auto_review` tools.
For the describe tool, the `add_original_user_description` and `keep_original_user_title` parameters will be set to true.

However, you can override the default tool parameters by uploading a local configuration file called `.pr_agent.toml` to the root of your repo.
For example, if your local `.pr_agent.toml` file contains:
```
[pr_description]
add_original_user_description = false
keep_original_user_title = false
```
When a new PR is opened, PR-Agent will run the `describe` tool with the above parameters.

Note that a local `.pr_agent.toml` file enables you to edit and customize the default parameters of any tool, not just the ones that are run automatically.

#### Editing the prompts
The prompts for the various PR-Agent tools are defined in the `pr_agent/settings` folder.

In practice, the prompts are loaded and stored as a standard setting object. 
Hence, editing them is similar to editing any other configuration value - just place the relevant key in `.pr_agent.toml`file, and override the default value.

For example, if you want to edit the prompts of the [describe](./pr_agent/settings/pr_description_prompts.toml) tool, you can add the following to your `.pr_agent.toml` file:
```
[pr_description_prompt]
system="""
...
"""
user="""
...
"""
```
Note that the new prompt will need to generate an output compatible with the relevant [post-process function](./pr_agent/tools/pr_description.py#L137).

### Working with GitHub Action
TBD

### Appendix - additional configurations walkthrough

#### Changing a model
See [here](pr_agent/algo/__init__.py) for the list of available models.

#### Azure
To use Azure, set: 
```
api_key = "" # your azure api key
api_type = "azure"
api_version = '2023-05-15'  # Check Azure documentation for the current API version
api_base = ""  # The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource. e.g. "https://<your resource name>.openai.azure.com"
deployment_id = ""  # The deployment name you chose when you deployed the engine
```
in your .secrets.toml

and 
```
[config]
model="" # the OpenAI model you've deployed on Azure (e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo)
```
in the configuration.toml 

#### Huggingface

**Local**  
You can run Huggingface models locally through either [VLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/vllm) or [Ollama](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/ollama)

E.g. to use a new Huggingface model locally via Ollama, set:
```
[__init__.py]
MAX_TOKENS = {
    "model-name-on-ollama": <max_tokens>
}
e.g.
MAX_TOKENS={
    ...,
    "llama2": 4096
}


[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "ollama/llama2"

[ollama] # in .secrets.toml
api_base = ... # the base url for your huggingface inference endpoint 
```

**Inference Endpoints**

To use a new model with Huggingface Inference Endpoints, for example, set:
```
[__init__.py]
MAX_TOKENS = {
    "model-name-on-huggingface": <max_tokens>
}
e.g.
MAX_TOKENS={
    ...,
    "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": 4096
}
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "huggingface/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"

[huggingface] # in .secrets.toml
key = ... # your huggingface api key
api_base = ... # the base url for your huggingface inference endpoint 
```
(you can obtain a Llama2 key from [here](https://replicate.com/replicate/llama-2-70b-chat/api))

#### Replicate

To use Llama2 model with Replicate, for example, set:
```
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "replicate/llama-2-70b-chat:2c1608e18606fad2812020dc541930f2d0495ce32eee50074220b87300bc16e1"
[replicate] # in .secrets.toml
key = ...
```
(you can obtain a Llama2 key from [here](https://replicate.com/replicate/llama-2-70b-chat/api))


Also review the [AiHandler](pr_agent/algo/ai_handler.py) file for instruction how to set keys for other models.

#### Extra instructions
All PR-Agent tools have a parameter called `extra_instructions`, that enables to add free-text extra instructions. Example usage:
```
/update_changelog --pr_update_changelog.extra_instructions="Make sure to update also the version ..."
```

#### Azure DevOps provider
To use Azure DevOps provider use the following settings in configuration.toml:
```
[config]
git_provider="azure"
use_repo_settings_file=false
```

And use the following settings (you have to replace the values) in .secrets.toml:
```
[azure_devops]
org = "https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORGANIZATION/"
pat = "YOUR_PAT_TOKEN"
```

#### Similar issue tool

[Example usage](https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ASL/issues/107)

<img src=./pics/similar_issue_tool.png width="768">

To enable usage of the '**similar issue**' tool, you need to set the following keys in `.secrets.toml` (or in the relevant environment variables):
```
[pinecone]
api_key = "..."
environment = "..."
```
These parameters can be obtained by registering to [Pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io/?sessionType=signup/).

- To invoke the 'similar issue' tool from **CLI**, run:
`python3 cli.py --issue_url=... similar_issue`

- To invoke the 'similar' issue tool via online usage, [comment](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/issues/178#issuecomment-1716934893) on a PR:
`/similar_issue`

- You can also enable the 'similar issue' tool to run automatically when a new issue is opened, by adding it to the [pr_commands list in the github_app section](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml#L66)
