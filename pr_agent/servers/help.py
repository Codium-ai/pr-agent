- When you first install the app, the [default mode](https://pr-agent-docs.codium.ai/usage-guide/automations_and_usage/#github-app-automatic-tools-when-a-new-pr-is-opened) for the describe tool is:
```
pr_commands = ["/describe", ...]

- Markers are an alternative way to control the generated description, to give maximal control to the user. If you set:
```
pr_commands = ["/describe --pr_description.use_description_markers=true", ...]
```
the tool will replace every marker of the form `pr_agent:marker_name` in the PR description with the relevant content, where `marker_name` is one of the following:
  - `type`: the PR type.
  - `summary`: the PR summary.
  - `walkthrough`: the PR walkthrough.

Note that when markers are enabled, if the original PR description does not contain any markers, the tool will not alter the description at all.

The default labels of the `describe` tool are quite generic: [`Bug fix`, `Tests`, `Enhancement`, `Documentation`, `Other`].

If you specify [custom labels](https://pr-agent-docs.codium.ai/tools/describe/#handle-custom-labels-from-the-repos-labels-page) in the repo's labels page or via configuration file, you can get tailored labels for your use cases.
Examples for custom labels:
- `Main topic:performance` - pr_agent:The main topic of this PR is performance
- `New endpoint` - pr_agent:A new endpoint was added in this PR
- `SQL query` - pr_agent:A new SQL query was added in this PR
- `Dockerfile changes` - pr_agent:The PR contains changes in the Dockerfile
- ...

The list above is eclectic, and aims to give an idea of different possibilities. Define custom labels that are relevant for your repo and use cases.
Note that Labels are not mutually exclusive, so you can add multiple label categories.
Make sure to provide proper title, and a detailed and well-phrased description for each label, so the tool will know when to suggest it.

For enhanced user experience, the `describe` tool can add file summaries directly to the "Files changed" tab in the PR page.

To enable inline file summary, set `pr_description.inline_file_summary` in the configuration file, possible values are:
- `'table'`: File changes walkthrough table will be displayed on the top of the "Files changed" tab, in addition to the "Conversation" tab.
- `true`: A collapsable file comment with changes title and a changes summary for each file in the PR.

Examples for extra instructions:
