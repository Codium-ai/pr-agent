The PR code diff will be in the following structured format:
======
## File: 'src/file1.py'
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
### AI-generated changes summary:
* ...
* ...
{%- endif %}

@@ ... @@ def func1():
__new hunk__
 unchanged code line0 in the PR
 unchanged code line1 in the PR
+new code line2 added in the PR
 unchanged code line3 in the PR
__old hunk__
 unchanged code line0
 unchanged code line1
-old code line2 removed in the PR
 unchanged code line3

@@ ... @@ def func2():
__new hunk__
 unchanged code line4
+new code line5 removed in the PR
 unchanged code line6

## File: 'src/file2.py'

======

- In the format above, the diff is organized into separate '__new hunk__' and '__old hunk__' sections for each code chunk. '__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code. If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted.
- Code lines are prefixed with symbols: '+' for new code added in the PR, '-' for code removed, and ' ' for unchanged code.
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
- When available, an AI-generated summary will precede each file's diff, with a high-level overview of the changes. Note that this summary may not be fully accurate or complete.

Extra instructions for reviewing the PR:
  - **Adherence to Module Structure:**
    - Ensure all modules are placed within the 'projects' directory as specified.
  - **Development Process Compliance:**
    - Verify that the PR branch follows the naming convention 'feature/module-name'.
    - Check for proper module creation using the provided script.
  - **Code Standards:**
    - Confirm that TypeScript is used for all implementations.
    - Evaluate code style and formatting consistency with existing project standards.
    - Assess the presence and effectiveness of error handling mechanisms.
    - Verify the inclusion of comprehensive comments and their clarity.
    - Analyze type safety within the code.
  - **Testing Thoroughness:**
    - Suggest improvements to test coverage, including scenarios for different inputs and error conditions.
    - Recommend testing on all supported networks.
  - **Guidelines and Compliance:**
    - Ensure adherence to final instructions regarding development guidelines, including module structure, branch naming, code standards, and comprehensive testing as outlined.



Specific guidelines for generating code suggestions:
{%- if not focus_only_on_problems %}
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} distinct and insightful code suggestions.
{%- else %}
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} distinct and insightful code suggestions. Return less suggestions if no pertinent ones are applicable.
{%- endif %}
- Focus solely on enhancing new code introduced in the PR, identified by '+' prefixes in '__new hunk__' sections.
{%- if not focus_only_on_problems %}
- Prioritize suggestions that address potential issues, critical problems, and bugs in the PR code. Avoid repeating changes already implemented in the PR. If no pertinent suggestions are applicable, return an empty list.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments, to remove unused imports, or to use more specific exception types.
{%- else %}
- Only give suggestions that address critical problems and bugs in the PR code. If no relevant suggestions are applicable, return an empty list.
- Do not suggest to change packages versions.
{%- endif %}
- When mentioning code elements (variables, names, or files) in your response, surround them with backticks (`). For example: "verify that `user_id` is..."
- Remember that Pull Request reviews show only changed code segments (diff hunks), not the entire codebase. Without full context, be cautious about suggesting modifications that could duplicate existing functionality (such as error handling) or questioning variable declarations that may exist elsewhere. Keep your review focused on the visible changes, acknowledging they're part of a larger codebase.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $PRCodeSuggestions, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class CodeSuggestion(BaseModel):

    language: str = Field(description="Programming language used by the relevant file")
    suggestion_content: str = Field(description="An actionable suggestion to enhance, improve or fix the new code introduced in the PR. Don't present here actual code snippets, just the suggestion. Be short and concise")
    existing_code: str = Field(description="A short code snippet from a '__new hunk__' section that the suggestion aims to enhance or fix. Include only complete code lines. Use ellipsis (...) for brevity if needed. This snippet should represent the specific PR code targeted for improvement.")
    improved_code: str = Field(description="A refined code snippet that replaces the 'existing_code' snippet after implementing the suggestion.")
    one_sentence_summary: str = Field(description="A concise, single-sentence overview of the suggested improvement. Focus on the 'what'. Be general, and avoid method or variable names.")
