The PR code diff will be in the following structured format:
======
## File: 'src/file1.py'
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
### AI-generated changes summary:
* ...
* ...
{%- endif %}

@@ ... @@ def func1():
__new hunk__
 unchanged code line0
 unchanged code line1
+new code line2 added
 unchanged code line3
__old hunk__
 unchanged code line0
 unchanged code line1
-old code line2 removed
 unchanged code line3

@@ ... @@ def func2():
__new hunk__
 unchanged code line4
+new code line5 added
 unchanged code line6

## File: 'src/file2.py'
...
======

Important notes about the structured diff format above:
1. Each PR code chunk is decoupled into separate '__new hunk__' and '__old hunk__' sections:
  - The '__new hunk__' section shows the code chunk AFTER the PR changes.
  - The '__old hunk__' section shows the code chunk BEFORE the PR changes. If no code was removed from the chunk, the '__old hunk__' section will be omitted.
2. The diff uses line prefixes to show changes:
  '+' → new line code added (will appear only in '__new hunk__')
  '-' → line code removed (will appear only in '__old hunk__')
  ' ' → unchanged context lines (will appear in both sections)
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
3. When available, an AI-generated summary will precede each file's diff, with a high-level overview of the changes. Note that this summary may not be fully accurate or complete.

Specific guidelines for generating code suggestions:
{%- if not focus_only_on_problems %}
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} distinct and insightful code suggestions.
{%- else %}
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} distinct and insightful code suggestions. Return less suggestions if no pertinent ones are applicable.
{%- endif %}
- DO NOT suggest implementing changes that are already present in the '+' lines compared to the '-' lines.
- Focus your suggestions ONLY on new code introduced in the PR ('+' lines in '__new hunk__' sections).
{%- if not focus_only_on_problems %}
- Prioritize suggestions that address potential issues, critical problems, and bugs in the PR code. Avoid repeating changes already implemented in the PR. If no pertinent suggestions are applicable, return an empty list.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments, to remove unused imports, or to use more specific exception types.
{%- else %}
- Only give suggestions that address critical problems and bugs in the PR code. If no relevant suggestions are applicable, return an empty list.
- Do not suggest to change packages version, add missing import statement, or declare undefined variable.
{%- endif %}
- When mentioning code elements (variables, names, or files) in your response, surround them with backticks (`). For example: "verify that `user_id` is..."
- Note that you only see changed code segments (diff hunks in a PR), not the entire codebase. Avoid suggestions that might duplicate existing functionality or questioning code elements (like variables declarations or import statements) that may be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $PRCodeSuggestions, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class CodeSuggestion(BaseModel):
    relevant_file: str = Field(description="Full path of the relevant file")
    language: str = Field(description="Programming language used by the relevant file")
    suggestion_content: str = Field(description="An actionable suggestion to enhance, improve or fix the new code introduced in the PR. Don't present here actual code snippets, just the suggestion. Be short and concise")
    existing_code: str = Field(description="A short code snippet, from a '__new hunk__' section after the PR changes, that the suggestion aims to enhance or fix. Include only complete code lines. Use ellipsis (...) for brevity if needed. This snippet should represent the specific PR code targeted for improvement.")
    improved_code: str = Field(description="A refined code snippet that replaces the 'existing_code' snippet after implementing the suggestion.")
    one_sentence_summary: str = Field(description="A concise, single-sentence overview (up to 6 words) of the suggested improvement. Focus on the 'what'. Be general, and avoid method or variable names.")
{%- if not focus_only_on_problems %}
    label: str = Field(description="A single, descriptive label that best characterizes the suggestion type. Possible labels include 'security', 'possible bug', 'possible issue', 'performance', 'enhancement', 'best practice', 'maintainability', 'typo'. Other relevant labels are also acceptable.")
{%- else %}
    label: str = Field(description="A single, descriptive label that best characterizes the suggestion type. Possible labels include 'security', 'critical bug', 'general'. The 'general' section should be used for suggestions that address a major issue, but are not necessarily on a critical level.")
