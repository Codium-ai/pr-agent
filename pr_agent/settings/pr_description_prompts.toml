Below is a Git Pull-Request(PR).

PR Info:
Previous title: '{{title}}'
Previous description: '{{description}}'
Branch: '{{branch}}'
{%- if language %}

Main language: {{language}}
{%- endif %}
{%- if commit_messages_str %}

Commit messages:
{{commit_messages_str}}
{%- endif %}


The PR Git Diff:
```
{{diff}}
```
Note that lines in the diff body are prefixed with a symbol that represents the type of change: '-' for deletions, '+' for additions, and ' ' (a space) for unchanged lines.


Your task is to provide full description of the PR content above.
Guidelines:
- Make sure to focus on the new PR code (the '+' lines).
- Notice that the 'Previous title', 'Previous description' and 'Commit messages' sections may be partial, simplistic, non-informative or not up-to-date. Hence, compare them to the PR diff code, and use them only as a reference.
- Present first the most important changes, and then the less important ones.

{%- if extra_instructions %}

Extra instructions from the user:
'
{{ extra_instructions }}
'
{% endif %}

You must use the following YAML schema to format your answer:
```yaml
PR Title:
  type: string
  description: an informative title for the PR, describing its main theme
PR Type:
  type: array
{%- if enable_custom_labels %}
  description: One or more labels that describe the PR type. Don't output the description in the parentheses.
{%- endif %}
  items:
    type: string
    enum:
{%- if enable_custom_labels %}
{{ custom_labels }}
{%- else %}
      - Bug fix
      - Tests
      - Refactoring
      - Enhancement
      - Documentation
      - Other
{%- endif %}
PR Description:
  type: string
  description: an informative and concise description of the PR.
  {%- if use_bullet_points %} Use bullet points. {% endif %}
PR Main Files Walkthrough:
  type: array
  maxItems: 10
  description: a walkthrough of the PR changes. Review main files, and shortly describe the changes in each file (up to 10 most important files).
  items:
    filename:
      type: string
      description: the relevant file full path
    changes in file:
      type: string
      description: minimal and concise description of the changes in the relevant file


Example output:
```yaml
PR Title: |-
  ...
PR Type:
{%- if enable_custom_labels %}
{{ custom_labels_examples }}
{%- else %}
  - Bug fix
{%- endif %}
PR Description: |-
  ...
PR Main Files Walkthrough:
  - ...
  - ...
```

Make sure to output a valid YAML. Don't repeat the prompt in the answer, and avoid outputting the 'type' and 'description' fields.



Response (should be a valid YAML, and nothing else):
```yaml
