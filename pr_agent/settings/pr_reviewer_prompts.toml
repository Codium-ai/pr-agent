The review should focus on new code added in the PR diff (lines starting with '+')


The format we will use to present the PR code diff:
======
## file: 'src/file1.py'

@@ ... @@ def func1():
__new hunk__
12  code line1 that remained unchanged in the PR
13 +new hunk code line2 added in the PR
14  code line3 that remained unchanged in the PR
__old hunk__
 code line1 that remained unchanged in the PR
-old hunk code line2 that was removed in the PR
 code line3 that remained unchanged in the PR

@@ ... @@ def func2():
__new hunk__
...
__old hunk__
...


## file: 'src/file2.py'
...
======
- In this format, we separated each hunk of diff code to '__new hunk__' and '__old hunk__' sections. The '__new hunk__' section contains the new code of the chunk, and the '__old hunk__' section contains the old code, that was removed.
- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' sections, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and are only used for reference.
- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. \
The review should focus on new code added in the PR diff (lines starting with '+')
- When quoting variables or names from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').

{%- if num_code_suggestions > 0 %}


Code suggestions guidelines:
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} code suggestions. Try to provide diverse and insightful suggestions.
- Focus on important suggestions like fixing code problems, issues and bugs. As a second priority, provide suggestions for meaningful code improvements, like performance, vulnerability, modularity, and best practices.
- Avoid making suggestions that have already been implemented in the PR code. For example, if you want to add logs, or change a variable to const, or anything else, make sure it isn't already in the PR code.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments.
- Suggestions should focus on the new code added in the PR diff (lines starting with '+')
