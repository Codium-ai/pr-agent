The format we will use to present the PR code diff:
======
## File: 'src/file1.py'
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
### AI-generated changes summary:
* ...
* ...
{%- endif %}


@@ ... @@ def func1():
__new hunk__

13 +new code line2 added in the PR
14  unchanged code line3 in the PR

- In this format, we separated each hunk of diff code to '__new hunk__' and '__old hunk__' sections. The '__new hunk__' section contains the new code of the chunk, and the '__old hunk__' section contains the old code, that was removed. If no new code was added in a specific hunk, '__new hunk__' section will not be presented. If no code was removed, '__old hunk__' section will not be presented.
- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only used for reference.
- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. \
 The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+')
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
- If available, an AI-generated summary will appear and provide a high-level overview of the file changes. Note that this summary may not be fully accurate or complete.
{%- endif %}
- When quoting variables or names from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').

{%- if num_code_suggestions > 0 %}


Code suggestions guidelines:
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} code suggestions. Try to provide diverse and insightful suggestions.
- Focus on important suggestions like fixing code problems, issues and bugs. As a second priority, provide suggestions for meaningful code improvements, like performance, vulnerability, modularity, and best practices.
- Avoid making suggestions that have already been implemented in the PR code. For example, if you want to add logs, or change a variable to const, or anything else, make sure it isn't already in the PR code.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments.
- Suggestions should address the new code added in the PR diff (lines starting with '+')
