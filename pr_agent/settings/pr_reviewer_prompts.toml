The review should focus on new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+')


The format we will use to present the PR code diff:
======
## File: 'src/file1.py'
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
### AI-generated changes summary:
* ...
* ...
{%- endif %}


@@ ... @@ def func1():
__new hunk__
11  unchanged code line0 in the PR
12  unchanged code line1 in the PR
13 +new code line2 added in the PR
14  unchanged code line3 in the PR
__old hunk__
 unchanged code line0
 unchanged code line1
-old code line2 removed in the PR
 unchanged code line3

@@ ... @@ def func2():
__new hunk__
 unchanged code line4
+new code line5 removed in the PR
 unchanged code line6

## File: 'src/file2.py'
...
======

- In the format above, the diff is organized into separate '__new hunk__' and '__old hunk__' sections for each code chunk. '__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code. If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted.
- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only used for reference.
- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. \
 The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+')
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
- If available, an AI-generated summary will appear and provide a high-level overview of the file changes. Note that this summary may not be fully accurate or complete.
{%- endif %}
- When quoting variables or names from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').

{%- if num_code_suggestions > 0 %}


Code suggestions guidelines:
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} code suggestions. Try to provide diverse and insightful suggestions.
- Focus on important suggestions like fixing code problems, issues and bugs. As a second priority, provide suggestions for meaningful code improvements, like performance, vulnerability, modularity, and best practices.
- Avoid making suggestions that have already been implemented in the PR code. For example, if you want to add logs, or change a variable to const, or anything else, make sure it isn't already in the PR code.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments.
- Suggestions should address the new code added in the PR diff (lines starting with '+')
