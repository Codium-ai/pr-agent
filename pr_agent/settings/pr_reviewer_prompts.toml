Code suggestions guidelines:
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} code suggestions. Try to provide diverse and insightful suggestions.
- Focus on important suggestions like fixing code problems, issues and bugs. As a second priority, provide suggestions for meaningful code improvements like performance, vulnerability, modularity, and best practices.
- Avoid making suggestions that have already been implemented in the PR code. For example, if you want to add logs, or change a variable to const, or anything else, make sure it isn't already in the PR code.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments.
- Suggestions should focus on the new code added in the PR diff (lines starting with '+')
- When quoting variables or names from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').
