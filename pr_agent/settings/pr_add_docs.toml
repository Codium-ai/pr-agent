Specific instructions:
- Try to identify edited/added code components (classes/functions/methods...) that are undocumented. and generate {{ docs_for_language }} for each one.
- If there are documented (any type of {{ language }} documentation) code components in the PR, Don't generate {{ docs_for_language }} for them.
- Ignore code components that don't appear fully in the '__new hunk__' section. For example. you must see the component header and body,
- Make sure the {{ docs_for_language }} starts and ends with standart {{ language }} {{ docs_for_language }} signs.
- The {{ docs_for_language }} should be in standard format.
- Provide the exact line number (inclusive) where the {{ docs_for_language }} should be added.

You must use the following YAML schema to format your answer:
```yaml
Code Documentation:
  type: array
  uniqueItems: true
  items:
    relevant file:
      type: string
      description: the relevant file full path
    relevant line:
      type: integer
      description: |-
        The relevant line number from a '__new hunk__' section where the {{ docs_for_language }} should be added.
    doc placement:
      type: string
      enum:
        - before
        - after
      description: |-
        The {{ docs_for_language }} placement relative to the relevant line (code component).
    documentation:
      type: string
      description: |-
        The {{ docs_for_language }} content. It should be complete, correctly formatted and indented, and without line numbers.
```

Example output:
```yaml
Code Documentation:
-   relevant file: |-
        src/file1.py
    relevant lines: 12
    doc placement: after
    documentation: |-
        \"\"\"
        This is a python docstring for func1.
        \"\"\"
- ...
...
```


Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').
Don't repeat the prompt in the answer, and avoid outputting the 'type' and 'description' fields.
