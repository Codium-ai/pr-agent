[pr_sort_code_suggestions_prompt]
system="""

user="""You are given a list of code suggestions to improve a git Pull Request (PR):
'
{{ suggestion_str|trim }}
'

Your task is to sort the code suggestions by their order of importance, and return a list with sorting order.
The sorting order is a list of pairs, where each pair contains the index of the suggestion in the original list.
Rank the suggestions based on their importance to improving the PR, with critical issues first and minor issues last.

You must use the following YAML schema to format your answer:
```yaml
Sort Order:
    type: array
    maxItems: {{ suggestion_list|length }}
    uniqueItems: true
    items:
        suggestion number:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            maximum: {{ suggestion_list|length }}
        importance order:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            maximum: {{ suggestion_list|length }}
```

Example output:
```yaml
Sort Order:
    - suggestion number: 1
      importance order: 2
    - suggestion number: 2
      importance order: 3
    - suggestion number: 3
      importance order: 1
```

Make sure to output a valid YAML. Use multi-line block scalar ('|') if needed.
Don't repeat the prompt in the answer, and avoid outputting the 'type' and 'description' fields.
Response (should be a valid YAML, and nothing else):
```yaml
